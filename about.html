				"Nossa tradição conta sobre 4 naves espaciais: <br />
				Uma, pelas quais voamos pelos céus, <br />
				Duas, que de tão velhas, temos que destruí-las para as refazermos, <br />
				Três, que as abandonamos, pois são perigosas demais para mantermos, <br />
				E a quarta, que não sabemos de nada sobre elas, <br />
				mas sabemos que estão acima de nós, nos observando." <br />
				<p class="quote">Rainha Stella XI, "Estrela da Sabedoria", 3000 A.C., 300 D.D. (Depois do Cataclisma)</p>

				That's a history of a far and dark future, 
				where our galaxy has been stormed by centuries of war. 
				A history about giant and abandoned ships; 
				each one that owns your history, your travels made,
				and your secrets that flies inside through the space. 
				And this is a history about people, who live in these difficult times, 
				searching these ghost ships that everyone thought they not existed anymore.
